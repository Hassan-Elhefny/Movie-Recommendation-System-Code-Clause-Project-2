# Movies Recommendation System

## Dataset and Notebook Description

In this kernel we'll be building a baseline **Movie Recommendation
System** using **[TMDB 5000 Movie
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).** For novices
like me this kernel will pretty much serve as a foundation in
recommendation systems and will provide you with something to start
with. **There are basically three types of recommender systems:-**

> -   **Demographic Filtering**- They offer generalized recommendations
>     to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System
>     recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic
>     features. Since each user is different , this approach is
>     considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is
>     that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will
>     have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.

> -   **Content Based Filtering**- They suggest similar items based on a
>     particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre,
>     director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these
>     recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems
>     is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also
>     like an item that is similar to it.

> -   **Collaborative Filtering**- This system matches persons with
>     similar interests and provides recommendations based on this
>     matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like
>     its content-based counterparts.

# **Demographic Filtering** -

Before getting started with this -

-   we need a metric to score or rate movie
-   Calculate the score for every movie
-   Sort the scores and recommend the best rated movie to the users.

We can use the average ratings of the movie as the score but using this
won't be fair enough since a movie with 8.9 average rating and only 3
votes cannot be considered better than the movie with 7.8 as as average
rating but 40 votes. So, I'll be using IMDB's weighted rating (wr) which
is given as :-

![](https://image.ibb.co/jYWZp9/wr.png) where,

-   v is the number of votes for the movie;
-   m is the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart;
-   R is the average rating of the movie; And
-   C is the mean vote across the whole report

We already have v(**vote_count**) and R (**vote_average**) and C can be
calculated as

</div>

<div class="cell code" execution_count="5">

``` python
C= df2['vote_average'].mean()
C
```

<div class="output execute_result" execution_count="5">

    6.092171559442016

</div>

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

**So, the mean rating for all the movies is approx 6 on a scale of
10.The next step is to determine an appropriate value for m, the minimum
votes required to be listed in the chart. We will use 90th percentile as
our cutoff. In other words, for a movie to feature in the charts, it
must have more votes than at least 90% of the movies in the list.**

</div>

<div class="cell code" execution_count="6">

``` python
m= df2['vote_count'].quantile(0.9)
m
```

<div class="output execute_result" execution_count="6">

    1838.4000000000015

</div>

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

**Now, we can filter out the movies that qualify for the chart**

</div>

<div class="cell code" execution_count="7">

``` python
q_movies = df2.copy().loc[df2['vote_count'] >= m]
q_movies.shape
```

<div class="output execute_result" execution_count="7">

    (481, 20)

</div>

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

We see that there are 481 movies which qualify to be in this list. Now,
we need to calculate our metric for each qualified movie. To do this, we
will define a function, **weighted_rating()** and define a new feature
**score**, of which we'll calculate the value by applying this function
to our DataFrame of qualified movies:

</div>

<div class="cell code" execution_count="8">

``` python
def weighted_rating(x, m=m, C=C):
    v = x['vote_count']
    R = x['vote_average']
    # Calculation based on the IMDB formula
    return (v/(v+m) * R) + (m/(m+v) * C)
```

</div>

<div class="cell code" execution_count="9">

``` python
# Define a new feature 'score' and calculate its value with `weighted_rating()`
q_movies['score'] = q_movies.apply(weighted_rating, axis=1)
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Finally, let's sort the DataFrame based on the score feature and output
the title, vote count, vote average and weighted rating or score of the
top 15 movies.

</div>

<div class="cell code" execution_count="10">

``` python
#Sort movies based on score calculated above
q_movies = q_movies.sort_values('score', ascending=False)

#Print the top 15 movies
q_movies[['title', 'vote_count', 'vote_average', 'score']].head(15)
```

# **Content Based Filtering**

**In this recommender system the content of the movie (overview, cast,
crew, keyword, tagline etc) is used to find its similarity with other
movies. Then the movies that are most likely to be similar are
recommended.**

## **Plot description based Recommender**

We will compute pairwise similarity scores for all movies based on their
plot descriptions and recommend movies based on that similarity score.
The plot description is given in the **overview** feature of our
dataset. Let's take a look at the data. ..

For any of you who has done even a bit of text processing before knows
we need to convert the word vector of each overview. Now we'll compute
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors for each
overview.

Now if you are wondering what is term frequency , it is the relative
frequency of a word in a document and is given as **(term
instances/total instances)**. Inverse Document Frequency is the relative
count of documents containing the term is given as **log(number of
documents/documents with term)** The overall importance of each word to
the documents in which they appear is equal to **TF \* IDF**

This will give you a matrix where each column represents a word in the
overview vocabulary (all the words that appear in at least one document)
and each row represents a movie, as before.This is done to reduce the
importance of words that occur frequently in plot overviews and
therefore, their significance in computing the final similarity score.

Fortunately, scikit-learn gives you a built-in TfIdfVectorizer class
that produces the TF-IDF matrix in a couple of lines. That's great,
isn't it?

**Since we have used the TF-IDF vectorizer, calculating the dot product
will directly give us the cosine similarity score. Therefore, we will
use sklearn's **linear_kernel()\*\* instead of cosine_similarities()
since it is faster.\*\*

We are going to define a function that takes in a movie title as an
input and outputs a list of the 10 most similar movies. Firstly, for
this, we need a reverse mapping of movie titles and DataFrame indices.
In other words, we need a mechanism to identify the index of a movie in
our metadata DataFrame, given its title.

</div>

<div class="cell code" execution_count="19">

``` python
#Construct a reverse map of indices and movie titles
indices = pd.Series(df2.index, index=df2['title']).drop_duplicates()
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

We are now in a good position to define our recommendation function.
These are the following steps we'll follow :-

-   Get the index of the movie given its title.
-   Get the list of cosine similarity scores for that particular movie
    with all movies. Convert it into a list of tuples where the first
    element is its position and the second is the similarity score.
-   Sort the aforementioned list of tuples based on the similarity
    scores; that is, the second element.
-   Get the top 10 elements of this list. Ignore the first element as it
    refers to self (the movie most similar to a particular movie is the
    movie itself).
-   Return the titles corresponding to the indices of the top elements.

<div class="cell code" execution_count="20">

``` python
# Function that takes in movie title as input and outputs most similar movies
def get_recommendations(title, cosine_sim=cosine_sim):
    # Get the index of the movie that matches the title
    idx = indices[title]

    # Get the pairwsie similarity scores of all movies with that movie
    sim_scores = list(enumerate(cosine_sim[idx]))

    # Sort the movies based on the similarity scores
    sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Get the scores of the 10 most similar movies
    sim_scores = sim_scores[1:11]

    # Get the movie indices
    movie_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]

    # Return the top 10 most similar movies
    return df2['title'].iloc[movie_indices]
